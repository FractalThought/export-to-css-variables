# Export styles to CSS variables

A small plugin to Figma for generating and exporting your styles to CSS custom properties (variables).

To use, create some styles, run the plugin, select your color system (RGBA, Hex, or HSLA), and hit Generate.

The plugin generates the following:
- Color in the selected color system
- Text size
- Box-shadow from effects
- Blur filter from effects
